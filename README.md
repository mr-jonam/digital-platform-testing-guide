## Start here

- [Decision guide](docs/guide.html): public-source context and original discussion questions.
- [Try the mini tool](docs/tool.html): testing conversation finder.
- [Sources and retrieval limitations](docs/references.html).
- [Prepare a collaboration request](docs/contact.html): local copy/download; contact pending.
- [Optional orientation skill](skills/digital-platform-testing-guide/SKILL.md).

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser or use the local preview:

```sh
npm run preview
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:4173](http://127.0.0.1:4173). No package installation is needed. Node.js 22 or later is used for the optional preview and configuration commands. The static pages also work from local files.

## What you can learn

- Identify a relevant platform or cross-platform reading path.
- Separate business assurance, technical evidence and release accountability.
- Prepare a focused first conversation without disclosing implementation details.

The mini tool works in the browser without sign-up, cookies, analytics, external libraries, AI API calls or platform connections. Results reflect user selections or assumptions. Copying and text downloads are user initiated.

## From a useful question to a collaboration

1. Read the decision guide and official references.
2. Use the mini tool to identify what needs clarification.
3. Copy the questions you want to discuss and prepare a sanitised request.
4. Use the publisher’s approved private contact channel when configured.

A first conversation can clarify the evidence question, its scope and whether a further engagement would be useful. No qualifications, client results, team history or service commitments are asserted. Never post client context or assessment requests in public issues.
